Map-style DataPipes
===========================

.. currentmodule:: torchdata.datapipes.map

A Map-style DataPipe is one that implements the ``__getitem__()`` and ``__len__()`` protocols, and represents a map
from (possibly non-integral) indices/keys to data samples. This is a close equivalent of ``Dataset`` from the PyTorch
core library.

For example, when accessed with ``mapdatapipe[idx]``, could read the ``idx``-th image and its
corresponding label from a folder on the disk.

.. autoclass:: MapDataPipe


By design, there are fewer ``MapDataPipe`` than ``IterDataPipe`` to avoid duplicate implementations of the same
functionalities as ``MapDataPipe``. We encourage users to use the built-in ``IterDataPipe`` for various functionalities,
and convert it to ``MapDataPipe`` as needed using :class:`.IterToMapConverter` or ``.to_map_datapipe()``.
If you have any question about usage or best practices while using ``MapDataPipe``, feel free to ask on the PyTorch
forum under the `'data' category <https://discuss.pytorch.org/c/data/37>`_.

We are open to add additional ``MapDataPipe`` where the operations can be lazily executed and ``__len__`` can be
known in advance. Feel free to make suggestions with description of your use case in
`this Github issue <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/57031>`_. Feedback about our design choice is also
welcomed in that Github issue.

Here is the list of available Map-style DataPipes:
