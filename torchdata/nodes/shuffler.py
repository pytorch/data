    """Node that shuffles items from source node using a buffer.
    This node maintains a buffer of items from the source node and returns them
    in a random order. The buffer is filled to capacity initially and then
    replenished as items are removed. The randomization is controlled by a
    random number generator with an optional seed for reproducibility.

    Args:
        source_node (BaseNode[T]): The source node to pull items from.
        buffer_size (int, optional): Size of the buffer used for shuffling. Must be at least 1.
            Defaults to 1024.
        seed (Optional[int]): Optional seed for the random number generator.
        store_buffer (bool, optional): Whether to store buffer contents in state for full
            reproducibility. If True, buffer contents are serialized which ensures perfect
            state restoration but may be slower and use more memory. If False, buffer is
            not stored which is faster but may affect reproducibility. Defaults to True.
