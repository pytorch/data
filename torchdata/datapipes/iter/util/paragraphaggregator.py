    r"""
    Iterable DataPipe that aggregates lines of text from the same file into a single paragraph.
    Specifically, this accepts a DataPipe consisting of tuples of a file name and a line. For each tuple,
    it checks if the file name matches the file name from the previous tuple. If yes, it joins the current line
    with existing paragraph. If the file names do not match, the existing paragraph is yielded and a new
    paragraph starts.

        source_datapipe: a DataPipe with tuples of a file name and a line
        joiner: a function that joins a list of lines together
