    Takes a `Dict` of (IterDataPipe, Weight), and yields items by sampling from these
    DataPipes with respect to their weights. When individual DataPipes are exhausted, continues to sample from
    the remaining DataPipes according to their relative weights.
    If you wish to maintain the same ratio of weights indefinitely, you need to ensure that the
    inputs are never exhausted, by, for instance, applying ``cycle`` to them.

    Sampling is controlled by the provided random ``seed``. If you don't provide it, the sampling
    will not be deterministic.

    Args:
        pipes_to_weights_dict: a `Dict` of IterDataPipes and Weights. The total weight of
            unexhausted DataPipes will be normalized to 1 for the purpose of sampling.
