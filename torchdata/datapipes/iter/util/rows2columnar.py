    Iterable DataPipe that accepts an input DataPipe with batches of data, and each row
    within a batch must either be a Dict or a List. This DataPipe processes one batch
    at a time and yields a Dict for each batch, with column names as keys and lists of
    corresponding values from each row as values.

    Note: If column names are not given and each row is a Dict, the keys of that Dict will be used as column names.

        source_datapipe: a DataPipe where each item is a batch. Within each batch,
            there are rows and each row is a List or Dict.
