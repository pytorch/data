r"""Definition of the StatefulDataLoader and associated iterators.

This file is a stand-in for torch.utils.data.dataloader, and includes a
StatefulDataLoader, which inherits from DataLoader and adds
state_dict/load_state_dict methods, as well as implementations for
single and multi-process iterators which are also stateful.

Where possible, we import the original definitions from torch.utils.data.dataloader,
and use inheritance for base classes only (StatefulDataLoader, _StatefulBaseDataLoaderIter).

For the single and multi-process iterator implementations, we fork the code to avoid a
diamond-shaped multiple-inheritance scheme.

class StatefulDataLoader(DataLoader[T_co]):
    r"""
    This is a drop in replacement for :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
    that implements state_dict and load_state_dict methods, enabling mid-epoch
    checkpointing.

    All arguments are identical to :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, with
    a new kwarg: `snapshot_every_n_steps: Optional[int] = `.
    See :py:mod:`torch.utils.data` documentation page for more details.

    Args:
        dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
        batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
            (default: ``1``).
        shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
            at every epoch (default: ``False``).
        sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): defines the strategy to draw
            samples from the dataset. Can be any ``Iterable`` with ``__len__``
            implemented. If specified, :attr:`shuffle` must not be specified.
        batch_sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): like :attr:`sampler`, but
            returns a batch of indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with
            :attr:`batch_size`, :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`,
            and :attr:`drop_last`.
        num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
            loading. ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
            (default: ``0``)
        collate_fn (Callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
            mini-batch of Tensor(s).  Used when using batched loading from a
            map-style dataset.
        pin_memory (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will copy Tensors
            into device/CUDA pinned memory before returning them.  If your data elements
            are a custom type, or your :attr:`collate_fn` returns a batch that is a custom type,
            see the example below.
        drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
            if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
            the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
            will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
        timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
            from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
        worker_init_fn (Callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
            worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
            input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)
        multiprocessing_context (str or multiprocessing.context.BaseContext, optional): If
            ``None``, the default `multiprocessing context`_ of your operating system will
            be used. (default: ``None``)
        generator (torch.Generator, optional): If not ``None``, this RNG will be used
            by RandomSampler to generate random indexes and multiprocessing to generate
            ``base_seed`` for workers. (default: ``None``)
        prefetch_factor (int, optional, keyword-only arg): Number of batches loaded
            in advance by each worker. ``2`` means there will be a total of
            2 * num_workers batches prefetched across all workers. (default value depends
            on the set value for num_workers. If value of num_workers=0 default is ``None``.
            Otherwise, if value of ``num_workers > 0`` default is ``2``).
        persistent_workers (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will not shut down
            the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed once. This allows to
            maintain the workers `Dataset` instances alive. (default: ``False``)
        pin_memory_device (str, optional): the device to :attr:`pin_memory` to if ``pin_memory`` is
            ``True``.


    .. warning:: If the ``spawn`` start method is used, :attr:`worker_init_fn`
                 cannot be an unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function. See
                 :ref:`multiprocessing-best-practices` on more details related
                 to multiprocessing in PyTorch.

    .. warning:: ``len(dataloader)`` heuristic is based on the length of the sampler used.
                 When :attr:`dataset` is an :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`,
                 it instead returns an estimate based on ``len(dataset) / batch_size``, with proper
                 rounding depending on :attr:`drop_last`, regardless of multi-process loading
                 configurations. This represents the best guess PyTorch can make because PyTorch
                 trusts user :attr:`dataset` code in correctly handling multi-process
                 loading to avoid duplicate data.

                 However, if sharding results in multiple workers having incomplete last batches,
                 this estimate can still be inaccurate, because (1) an otherwise complete batch can
                 be broken into multiple ones and (2) more than one batch worth of samples can be
                 dropped when :attr:`drop_last` is set. Unfortunately, PyTorch can not detect such
                 cases in general.

                 See `Dataset Types`_ for more details on these two types of datasets and how
                 :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` interacts with
                 `Multi-process data loading`_.

    .. warning:: See :ref:`reproducibility`, and :ref:`dataloader-workers-random-seed`, and
                 :ref:`data-loading-randomness` notes for random seed related questions.

    # P.S. `worker_result_queue` and `pin_memory_thread` part may be omitted if
    #      `pin_memory=False`.
    #
    #
    # Terminating multiprocessing logic requires very careful design. In
    # particular, we need to make sure that
    #
    #   1. The iterator gracefully exits the workers when its last reference is
    #      gone or it is depleted.
    #
    #      In this case, the workers should be gracefully exited because the
    #      main process may still need to continue to run, and we want cleaning
    #      up code in the workers to be executed (e.g., releasing GPU memory).
    #      Naturally, we implement the shutdown logic in `__del__` of
    #      DataLoaderIterator.
    #
    #      We delay the discussion on the logic in this case until later.
    #
    #   2. The iterator exits the workers when the loader process and/or worker
    #      processes exits normally or with error.
    #
    #      We set all workers and `pin_memory_thread` to have `daemon=True`.
    #
    #      You may ask, why can't we make the workers non-daemonic, and
    #      gracefully exit using the same logic as we have in `__del__` when the
    #      iterator gets deleted (see 1 above)?
    #
    #      First of all, `__del__` is **not** guaranteed to be called when
    #      interpreter exits. Even if it is called, by the time it executes,
    #      many Python core library resources may already be freed, and even
    #      simple things like acquiring an internal lock of a queue may hang.
    #      Therefore, in this case, we actually need to prevent `__del__` from
    #      being executed, and rely on the automatic termination of daemonic
    #      children.
    #
    #      Thus, we register an `atexit` hook that sets a global flag
    #      `_utils.python_exit_status`. Since `atexit` hooks are executed in the
    #      reverse order of registration, we are guaranteed that this flag is
    #      set before library resources we use are freed (which, at least in
    #      CPython, is done via an `atexit` handler defined in
    #      `multiprocessing/util.py`
    #      https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c606624af8d4cb3b4a052fb263bb983b3f87585b/Lib/multiprocessing/util.py#L320-L362
    #      registered when an object requiring this mechanism is first
    #      created, e.g., `mp.Queue`
    #      https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c606624af8d4cb3b4a052fb263bb983b3f87585b/Lib/multiprocessing/context.py#L100-L103
    #      https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c606624af8d4cb3b4a052fb263bb983b3f87585b/Lib/multiprocessing/queues.py#L29
    #      )
    #
    #      So in `__del__`, we check if `_utils.python_exit_status` is set or
    #      `None` (freed), and perform no-op if so.
    #
    #      However, simply letting library clean-up codes run can also be bad,
    #      because such codes (i.e., `multiprocessing.util._exit_function()`)
    #      include join putting threads for `mp.Queue`, which can be blocking.
    #      Hence, the main process putting threads are called with
    #      `cancel_join_thread` at creation.  See later section
    #      [ 3b. A process won't hang when putting into a queue; ]
    #      for more details.
    #
    #      Here are two example cases where library clean-up codes can run
    #      before `__del__` is called:
    #
    #        1. If we hold onto a reference to the iterator, it more often
    #           than not tries to do `multiprocessing` library cleaning before
    #           clearing the alive referenced objects (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/48666)
    #           and thus prevents our cleaning-up code to run first.
    #
    #        2. A similar issue araises when a `DataLoader` is used in a subprocess.
    #           When a process ends, it shuts the all its daemonic children
    #           down with a SIGTERM (instead of joining them without a timeout).
    #           Simiarly for threads, but by a different mechanism. This fact,
    #           together with a few implementation details of multiprocessing, forces
    #           us to make workers daemonic. All of our problems arise when a
    #           DataLoader is used in a subprocess, and are caused by multiprocessing
    #           code which looks more or less like this:
    #
    #               try:
    #                   your_function_using_a_dataloader()
    #               finally:
    #                   multiprocessing.util._exit_function()
    #
    #           The joining/termination mentioned above happens inside
    #           `_exit_function()`. Now, if `your_function_using_a_dataloader()`
    #           throws, the stack trace stored in the exception will prevent the
    #           frame which uses `DataLoaderIter` to be freed. If the frame has any
    #           reference to the `DataLoaderIter` (e.g., in a method of the iter),
    #           its  `__del__`, which starts the shutdown procedure, will not be
    #           called. That, in turn, means that workers aren't notified. Attempting
    #           to join in `_exit_function` will then result in a hang.
    #
    #           For context, `_exit_function` is also registered as an `atexit` call.
    #           So it is unclear to me (@ssnl) why this is needed in a finally block.
    #           The code dates back to 2008 and there is no comment on the original
    #           PEP 371 or patch https://bugs.python.org/issue3050 (containing both
    #           the finally block and the `atexit` registration) that explains this.
    #
    #
    #      Finally, another choice is to just shutdown workers with logic in 1
    #      above whenever we see an error in `next`. This isn't ideal because
    #        a. It prevents users from using try-catch to resume data loading.
    #        b. It doesn't prevent hanging if users have references to the
    #           iterator.
    #
    #   3. All processes exit if any of them die unexpectedly by fatal signals.
    #
    #      As shown above, the workers are set as daemonic children of the main
    #      process. However, automatic cleaning-up of such child processes only
    #      happens if the parent process exits gracefully (e.g., not via fatal
    #      signals like SIGKILL). So we must ensure that each process will exit
    #      even the process that should send/receive data to/from it were
    #      killed, i.e.,
    #
    #        a. A process won't hang when getting from a queue.
    #
    #           Even with carefully designed data dependencies (i.e., a `put()`
    #           always corresponding to a `get()`), hanging on `get()` can still
    #           happen when data in queue is corrupted (e.g., due to
    #           `cancel_join_thread` or unexpected exit).
    #
    #           For child exit, we set a timeout whenever we try to get data
    #           from `data_queue`, and check the workers' status on each timeout
    #           and error.
    #           See `_DataLoaderiter._get_batch()` and
    #           `_DataLoaderiter._try_get_data()` for details.
    #
    #           Additionally, for child exit on non-Windows platforms, we also
    #           register a SIGCHLD handler (which is supported on Windows) on
    #           the main process, which checks if any of the workers fail in the
    #           (Python) handler. This is more efficient and faster in detecting
    #           worker failures, compared to only using the above mechanism.
    #           See `DataLoader.cpp` and `_utils/signal_handling.py` for details.
    #
    #           For `.get()` calls where the sender(s) is not the workers, we
    #           guard them with timeouts, and check the status of the sender
    #           when timeout happens:
    #             + in the workers, the `_utils.worker.ManagerWatchdog` class
    #               checks the status of the main process.
    #             + if `pin_memory=True`, when getting from `pin_memory_thread`,
    #               check `pin_memory_thread` status periodically until `.get()`
    #               returns or see that `pin_memory_thread` died.
    #
    #        b. A process won't hang when putting into a queue;
    #
    #           We use `mp.Queue` which has a separate background thread to put
    #           objects from an unbounded buffer array. The background thread is
    #           daemonic and usually automatically joined when the process
    #           *exits*.
    #
    #           In case that the receiver has ended abruptly while
    #           reading from the pipe, the join will hang forever.  The usual
    #           solution for this in Python is calling  `q.cancel_join_thread`,
    #           which prevents automatically joining it when finalizing
    #           (exiting).
    #
    #           Nonetheless, `cancel_join_thread` must only be called when the
    #           queue is **not** going to be read from or write into by another
    #           process, because it may hold onto a lock or leave corrupted data
    #           in the queue, leading other readers/writers to hang.
    #
    #           Hence,
    #             + For worker processes, we only do so (for their output
    #               queues, i.e., `worker_result_queue`) before exiting.
    #             + For `pin_memory_thread`, its output queue `data_queue` is a
    #               `queue.Queue` that does blocking `put` if the queue is full.
    #               So there is no above problem, but as a result, in
    #               `_pin_memory_loop`, we do need to  wrap the `put` in a loop
    #               that breaks not only upon success, but also when the main
    #               process stops reading, i.e., is shutting down.
    #             + For loader process, we `cancel_join_thread()` for all
    #               `_index_queues` because the whole purpose of workers and
    #               `pin_memory_thread` is to serve the loader process.  If
    #               loader process is already exiting, we don't really care if
    #               the queues are corrupted.
    #
    #
    # Now let's get back to 1:
    #   how we gracefully exit the workers when the last reference to the
    #   iterator is gone.
    #
    # To achieve this, we implement the following logic along with the design
    # choices mentioned above:
    #
    # `workers_done_event`:
    #   A `multiprocessing.Event` shared among the main process and all worker
    #   processes. This is used to signal the workers that the iterator is
    #   shutting down. After it is set, they will not send processed data to
    #   queues anymore, and only wait for the final `None` before exiting.
    #   `done_event` isn't strictly needed. I.e., we can just check for `None`
    #   from the input queue, but it allows us to skip wasting resources
    #   processing data if we are already shutting down.
    #
    # `pin_memory_thread_done_event`:
    #   A `threading.Event` for a similar purpose to that of
    #   `workers_done_event`, but is for the `pin_memory_thread`. The reason
    #   that separate events are needed is that `pin_memory_thread` reads from
    #   the output queue of the workers. But the workers, upon seeing that
    #   `workers_done_event` is set, only wants to see the final `None`, and is
    #   not required to flush all data in the output queue (e.g., it may call
    #   `cancel_join_thread` on that queue if its `IterableDataset` iterator
    #   happens to exhaust coincidentally, which is out of the control of the
    #   main process). Thus, since we will exit `pin_memory_thread` before the
    #   workers (see below), two separete events are used.
    #
    # NOTE: In short, the protocol is that the main process will set these
    #       `done_event`s and then the corresponding processes/threads a `None`,
    #       and that they may exit at any time after receiving the `None`.
    #
    # NOTE: Using `None` as the final signal is valid, since normal data will
    #       always be a 2-tuple with the 1st element being the index of the data
    #       transferred (different from dataset index/key), and the 2nd being
    #       either the dataset key or the data sample (depending on which part
    #       of the data model the queue is at).
    #
    # [ worker processes ]
    #   While loader process is alive:
    #     Get from `index_queue`.
    #       If get anything else,
    #          Check `workers_done_event`.
    #            If set, continue to next iteration
    #                    i.e., keep getting until see the `None`, then exit.
    #            Otherwise, process data:
    #                If is fetching from an `IterableDataset` and the iterator
    #                    is exhausted, send an `_IterableDatasetStopIteration`
    #                    object to signal iteration end. The main process, upon
    #                    receiving such an object, will send `None` to this
    #                    worker and not use the corresponding `index_queue`
    #                    anymore.
    #       If timed out,
    #          No matter `workers_done_event` is set (still need to see `None`)
    #          or not, must continue to next iteration.
    #   (outside loop)
    #   If `workers_done_event` is set,  (this can be False with `IterableDataset`)
    #     `data_queue.cancel_join_thread()`.  (Everything is ending here:
    #                                          main process won't read from it;
    #                                          other workers will also call
    #                                          `cancel_join_thread`.)
    #
    # [ pin_memory_thread ]
    #   # No need to check main thread. If this thread is alive, the main loader
    #   # thread must be alive, because this thread is set as daemonic.
    #   While `pin_memory_thread_done_event` is not set:
    #     Get from `worker_result_queue`.
    #       If timed out, continue to get in the next iteration.
    #       Otherwise, process data.
    #       While `pin_memory_thread_done_event` is not set:
    #         Put processed data to `data_queue` (a `queue.Queue` with blocking put)
    #         If timed out, continue to put in the next iteration.
    #         Otherwise, break, i.e., continuing to the out loop.
    #
    #   NOTE: we don't check the status of the main thread because
    #           1. if the process is killed by fatal signal, `pin_memory_thread`
    #              ends.
    #           2. in other cases, either the cleaning-up in __del__ or the
    #              automatic exit of daemonic thread will take care of it.
    #              This won't busy-wait either because `.get(timeout)` does not
    #              busy-wait.
    #
    # [ main process ]
    #   In the DataLoader Iter's `__del__`
    #     b. Exit `pin_memory_thread`
    #          i.   Set `pin_memory_thread_done_event`.
    #          ii   Put `None` in `worker_result_queue`.
    #          iii. Join the `pin_memory_thread`.
    #          iv.  `worker_result_queue.cancel_join_thread()`.
    #
    #     c. Exit the workers.
    #          i.   Set `workers_done_event`.
    #          ii.  Put `None` in each worker's `index_queue`.
    #          iii. Join the workers.
    #          iv.  Call `.cancel_join_thread()` on each worker's `index_queue`.
    #
    #        NOTE: (c) is better placed after (b) because it may leave corrupted
    #              data in `worker_result_queue`, which `pin_memory_thread`
    #              reads from, in which case the `pin_memory_thread` can only
    #              happen at timing out, which is slow. Nonetheless, same thing
    #              happens if a worker is killed by signal at unfortunate times,
    #              but in other cases, we are better off having a non-corrupted
    #              `worker_result_queue` for `pin_memory_thread`.
    #
    #   NOTE: If `pin_memory=False`, there is no `pin_memory_thread` and (b)
    #         can be omitted
    #
    # NB: `done_event`s isn't strictly needed. E.g., we can just check for
    #     `None` from `index_queue`, but it allows us to skip wasting resources
    #     processing indices already in `index_queue` if we are already shutting
    #     down.

    # NOTE [ DataLoader on Linux and open files limit ]
    #
    # On Linux when DataLoader is used with multiprocessing we pass the data between
    # the root process and the workers through SHM files. We remove those files from
    # the filesystem as soon as they are created and keep them alive by
    # passing around their file descriptors through AF_UNIX sockets. (See
    # docs/source/multiprocessing.rst and 'Multiprocessing Technical Notes` in
    # the wiki (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki).)
    #
    # This sometimes leads us to exceeding the open files limit. When that happens,
    # and the offending file descriptor is coming over a socket, the `socket` Python
    # package silently strips the file descriptor from the message, setting only the
    # `MSG_CTRUNC` flag (which might be a bit misleading since the manpage says that
    # it _indicates that some control data were discarded due to lack of space in
    # the buffer for ancillary data_). This might reflect the C implementation of
    # AF_UNIX sockets.
    #
    # This behaviour can be reproduced with the script and instructions at the
    # bottom of this note.
    #
    # When that happens, the standard Python `multiprocessing` (and not
    # `torch.multiprocessing`) raises a `RuntimeError: received 0 items of ancdata`
    #
    # Sometimes, instead of the FD being stripped, you may get an `OSError:
    # Too many open files`, both in the script below and in DataLoader. However,
    # this is rare and seems to be nondeterministic.

    # (shell2) ulimit -n 1022

    # 2. Run the script above with the `recv` option in the first shell
    # (shell1) ./test_socket.py sock_tmp 1017 recv
    #
    # 3. Run the script with the `send` option in the second shell:
    # (shell2) ./test_socket.py sock_tmp 1017 send
